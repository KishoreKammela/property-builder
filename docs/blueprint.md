# **App Name**: Content Form Builder

## Core Features:

- Data Input Form: Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting property data based on the provided data types and schema. It includes form fields for each property and section.
- Input Validation: Validate all form inputs according to the defined types and constraints. Ensure mandatory fields are filled and data types (e.g., URLs for images) are correct. Alert user about errors in case of incorrect types
- ID Generation: Generate short, unique, and SEO-friendly IDs for each content section. It can use property attributes as a tool.
- Alt Text Generation: Strategically generate alt text for images, based on the context and surrounding content. Aim for descriptive, accessible, and SEO-friendly text using key attributes of the containing property as a tool.
- JSON Preview and Export: Display a preview of the generated JSON object based on the filled data, providing an immediate feedback loop for content creators. Provide the user the ability to copy the generated json data with one click.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm, muted blue (#6699CC) to evoke trust and stability in real estate content creation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a neutral, clean canvas for data entry.
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#FF8C00) for calls to action (CTAs) like 'Generate JSON' and 'Copy to Clipboard'.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, clean appearance and readability, suitable for both headings and form input labels.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different data types (e.g., image, text, URL) in the form. For example a URL could use a link icon
- Employ a clear, hierarchical layout that groups related form fields into logical sections. Use expandable accordions or tabs for different content sections (e.g., 'Property Banner,' 'Location,' 'Amenities')
- Use subtle transitions when expanding/collapsing sections or displaying validation messages.
